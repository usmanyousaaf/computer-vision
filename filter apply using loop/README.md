## CV2 Filter Application on Images Using a Loop

This project uses the CV2 library in Python to apply various image filters to an image using a loop. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of CV2 filters in image processing and how they can be used to enhance an image's appearance.

### Code Description

The code first loads an image using the `cv2.imread()` function and then applies several filters to the image, including Gaussian blur, median blur, and bilateral filter, using a loop. The loop allows the code to apply the filters to the image one by one, allowing for easy comparison of the image before and after each filter is applied.

### Usage

To use this code, simply clone the Git repository and run the Python file. You will need to have the CV2 library installed on your computer to run this code.
